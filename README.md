Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced software developer and freelancer with over 5 years of experience helping clients build new products or support businesses with tech. I have worked with well-known e-commerce organizations such as Tesco UK, RainbowShops USA, and BlockAsset UK. My expertise lies in Full Stack development using MERN stack, GraphQL applications, Typescript, Nestjs and OAuth2.

My notable achievements include hosting Blockasset backend from scratch using Nestjs and MongoDB. I also led and delivered an E-commerce store that supports both web2 and web3 user journeys. I have also contributed to various web3 projects, such as minting tokens using Solana and dynamic token pricing using Strata protocol by listening to program accounts and integrating with the backend. I have also contributed to Tesco by developing an orchestration layer based on Node.js and GraphQL.

In addition, I have built a connector for Akeneo to Shopify for products and inventory sync.

# Hey, I'm Akash 👋

**Senior Software Engineer** building things at the intersection of **backend systems** and **AI automation**.

6+ years of turning complex problems into clean, scalable solutions — from distributed GraphQL architectures serving millions of users to AI agents that investigate and resolve support tickets autonomously.

### What I Do

🔧 **By Day** — Senior Software Engineer at **Tesco**, where I've led the migration from monolithic GraphQL to a federated architecture and built AI-powered support automation systems that integrate across engineering teams.

🚀 **By Night** — Built AI Marketing automation with multiple platforms where I experimented with agentic systems, MCP servers, and intelligent workflow orchestration.

### Tech I Work With

```
Backend        →  Node.js · NestJS · GraphQL · TypeScript · Python · Express
AI/Agents      →  LangGraph · LangChain · MCP · RAG · Agentic AI
Data           →  MongoDB · MySQL · Redis · Firebase
Cloud          →  GCP · Cloud Run · Docker · GitHub Actions
Monitoring     →  New Relic · Datadog
Frontend       →  React · Next.js
```

### Things I Care About

- **Distributed systems** that don't fall over at scale
- **AI agents** that actually solve real problems, not just demos
- **Developer experience** — clean APIs, good observability, sane abstractions
- **Building in public** — learning by shipping

---

### Beyond Code

When I'm not writing code, I'm probably doing calisthenics (working toward the human flag 💪), reading business strategy books, or exploring my next side project idea.
